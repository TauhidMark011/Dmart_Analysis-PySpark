📖 About the Project :- 
This project demonstrates how large-scale retail data can be processed efficiently using PySpark, a Python API for Apache Spark. The goal is to develop a scalable and modular pipeline that performs:
Data Ingestion: Reading CSV files into Spark DataFrames.
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Handling missing values, renaming columns, and formatting data for consistency.
Data Analysis: Executing group-based aggregations and business-level queries to uncover trends and metrics.
Result Presentation: Displaying the analytical outputs via terminal for quick insight delivery.
This end-to-end solution mirrors tasks often handled by Data Engineers and Big Data Analysts in modern data-driven companies.

🛠️ Technologies Used : 
Python 3.10+
Apache Spark (PySpark)
VS Code / Terminal
Git & GitHub

🚀 How to Run the Project :
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/TauhidMark011/Dmart_Analysis-PySpark
cd Dmart_PySpark_Project

Step 2: (Optional) Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Step 3: Install Required Package
pip install pyspark

Step 4: Run the Pipeline
python main_orchestrate.py

📊 Key Functionalities :
✔️ Data Cleaning:
Renames inconsistent column names
Removes null or irrelevant records (if present)
Casts data types appropriately for analysis

✔️ Business Insights Generated:
* Average Age per Customer Segment

* Orders per Shipping Mode

* Total Quantity Sold per City

* Customer Segment with Highest Total Profit

 Sample Output:
Customer Segment with Highest Total Profit:
+-----------+------------------+
| Segment   |   Total_Profit   |
+-----------+------------------+
| Consumer  | 134119.209199997 |
+-----------+------------------+

📌 Future Enhancements : 
✅ Export results to CSV/Parquet for reporting
📉 Add visualizations using matplotlib/seaborn
🔗 Integrate with AWS S3 or HDFS for cloud-scale data ingestion
🗃️ Load transformed data into a SQL or NoSQL data store
